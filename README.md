# Access Projects - Volume 1: This repo contains screen shots from two personal projects I've done in Microsoft Access

## A personal project I did some time ago to keep track of my monthly budgets (Can't decide on Quickbooks or Peachtree? Why not just make your own?)

## A project I made as a "challenge" for a mentor some time back, the idea which is to pair up career mentors (in various fields) with candidates looking to enter those fields.
### A video demo of this project can be found here : [![Watch the Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/yEX27vdyrmI?si=M8woUN53t58Tp4v4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEX27vdyrmI?si=M8woUN53t58Tp4v4)
